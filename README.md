> Simplify NVIDIA Isaac Sim development with *Isaac Powerpack*

**Isaac Powerpack** (or **Pow** for short) is a project management tool that aims to reduce friction of **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** application development.

Key features:

* ⚡ CLI to simplify Isaac Sim workstation installation, setup, and launching.
* 📁 Provides an organized folder structure, ready to get started.
* 📦 Keeps your Isaac Sim projects isolated from each other.
* 🛠️ Allows for configuring different Isaac Sim runtime settings via profiles.
* 🐢 Simple commands for building and running Isaac Sim ROS 2 Docker containers.
* 🎨 Local asset management and USDA linting tools.

For the full list of ready-to-use commands and options, see the [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in early development. Features and APIs are still evolving and are subject to breaking changes. Please check the [Changelog](packages/pow-cli/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates.


Pow CLI requires uv and Docker (for ROS 2 container support). Ensure both are installed before proceeding:
- [uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Setup your project

```bash
# create your project folder
mkdir sim-project && cd sim-project

# create pyproject.toml and initialize uv
uv init --bare

# add pow cli package
uv add "pow-cli==0.1.0rc1"

# Initialize project, install isaac sim, setup ROS, create config file
uv run pow init

# source your workspace
source .venv/bin/activate
```


### Usages

Run Isaac Sim

```bash

# Run Isaac Sim GUI
pow run

# or Run standalone app
pow python path/to/python_standalone_app.py
```

Run ROS 2 container

```bash
# Bash into the docker container, you can run this command multiple time
# later command will attach to the running container
pow ros
```

## Profiles

After running `pow init`, a `pow.toml` configuration file is generated in your project root. This file controls Isaac Sim runtime settings and supports multiple profiles, letting you switch between them depending on your use case:

```bash
pow run -p perf        # Use the "perf" profile
pow run -p default     # Use the default profile (or just `pow run`)
```

Each profile can extend another and override specific settings such as `cpu_performance_mode` or `headless`. To extend a list instead of replacing it, use the `.add` suffix (e.g. `exts.add`, `raw_args.add`).

In the example below, the `"perf"` profile extends `"default"`, enables CPU performance mode, and appends to `raw_args` using `raw_args.add`. Note that `exts` (without `.add`) replaces the inherited value entirely.

```toml
[sim]
version = "5.1.0"
ext_folders = ["./exts"]
cpu_performance_mode = false
headless = false
enable_ros = false
isaacsim_ros_ws = "~/IsaacSim-ros_workspaces"
exts = ["isaacsim.code_editor.vscode"]
raw_args = ["--/renderer/raytracingMotion/enabled=false"]

[[profiles]]
name = "perf"
extends = "default"
cpu_performance_mode = true
exts = ["your.custom.extension"]
raw_args.add = [
    # Enable frame generation 2x (RTX 50 series only)
    "--/rtx-transient/dlssg/enabled=true",
    "--/rtx-transient/internal/dlssg/interpolatedFrameCount=1",
    # Disable RTX features for better performance
    "--/rtx/reflections/enabled=false",
    "--/rtx/translucency/enabled=false"
]
```

For the full settings reference, profile inheritance, and examples, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Local Assets

The concept of Local assets is to download predefined assets in advanced from Nvidia Omniverse to your local machine to accelerate scene building and eliminate download bottleneck during scene creation. 

You can attach the assets directory using `pow asset set` command to `~/.pow/assets` and download provided collection using `pow asset add`. Currently, only official Isaac Sim assets are available to download with add command.

For more detail and feature about Local Assets command line, see `pow asset` command group in [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## Folder Structure    

After running `pow init`, your project will have the following structure:

```
sim-project/
├── .vscode/              # VSCode configuration (launch.json, settings.json, etc.)
├── .modules/             # 3rd party module that use in your project e.g. pegasus sim
├── .assets/              # 3D assets or any assets you use only in your project
├── exts/                 # Your custom Isaac Sim extensions
├── scripts/              # Isaacsim Helper scripts to execute via vscode
├── standalone/           # Standalone Python applications
├── usda/                 # USD scene description files
├── _isaacsim/            # Symlink → ~/.pow/isaacsim/5.1.0 for intellisense and autocomplete
├── .gitignore            # Pre-configured gitignore for Isaac Sim projects
├── pow.toml              # Project configuration (sim settings, profiles)
└── pyproject.toml        # Python project manifest
```

`pow init` also creates a **global directory** at `~/.pow` (shared across all projects):

```
~/.pow/
├── isaacsim/             # Downloaded Isaac Sim installations
│   └── 5.1.0/            # Isaac Sim 5.1.0 app files
├── modules/              # Shared modules
├── assets/               # mounting folder for local assets
└── system.toml           # Global system configuration
```
